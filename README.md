# Degree Centrality
It counts the number of connections each node in the network has. A node with a high degree of centrality in the network is interconnected with several other nodes.

# Betweenness centrality
Betweenness centrality measures the number of times a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes.

# Closeness centrality
Closeness centrality scores each node based on their ‘closeness’ to all other nodes in the network.

# Eigen vector Centrality
Like degree centrality, EigenCentrality measures a node’s influence based on the number of links it has to other nodes in the network. EigenCentrality then goes a step further by also taking into account how well connected a node is, and how many links their connections have, and so on through the network.

# PageRank centrality
Based on the quantity and quality of links pointing at a node, this gauges its significance inside a network. Web search engines frequently utilise it to rank the importance of web pages.
